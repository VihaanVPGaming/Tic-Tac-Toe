# Tic Tac Toe :x: :o:
The classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe and crosses created in Unity.  

Using UI elements and a simple game controller we re-created Tic-tac-toe. Players can set there names in the input fields and then you just mark three in a row to win!

## Getting Started :page_with_curl:
Clone or download this repository and open the project with your favourite flavour of Unity.  
_This project was built with Unity 2022.3.21f1_

## Edits Made to Orignal Code :pencil2:
Added a new script `EndGame.cs` to the orignal game, fixing the exit button code.
